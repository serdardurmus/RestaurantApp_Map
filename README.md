### Built With

## Features
This app comprises use of Stack Navigation and RESTFUL Web APIs
- User can either scroll or type letters into search bar to choose a city. 
- When the user finds the desired city and taps on it, a new page opens showing a list of restaurants in chosen city. Information here comprises an image and the name of the restaurants. Since the API source does not offer different images, only a default graphical was used all through the app.
